# AoC 2022

My (currently c# & python) solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022.

Competition solutions:

- Days 1-8 are in the "Day#" folders in [AoC_Python_2022](AoC_Python_2022)
- Days 9+ are in the "Day#" folders in [AoC_CSharp_2022](AoC_CSharp_2022)

Everything else in this repo is post-submission fiddling.
